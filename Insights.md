Insights from Titanic Survival Analysis
From the analysis of the Titanic dataset, a few clear patterns can be observed. Female passengers had a noticeably higher survival rate than male passengers, which suggests that women were given priority during the rescue process. Passengers travelling in first class survived more often than those in second and third class, showing that socio-economic status played an important role.
It was also observed that passengers who paid higher fares generally had better chances of survival. This could be linked to better cabin locations or faster access to lifeboats. Age did have some influence on survival, but it was not as strong as gender or passenger class.
Conclusion:
Overall, the survival of passengers on the Titanic was mainly influenced by gender, passenger class, and ticket fare, indicating that social and economic factors significantly affected rescue outcomes.
